Project: Restaurant
=============

A basic mock-up of a fictional restaurant.

Here's the [live project demo.](https://alansobchacki.github.io/odin-library/](https://alansobchacki.github.io/odin-js-restaurant/))

About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) curriculum. It is the third project required for completion of the JavaScript Course [3/12].

These were the project requirements:

- [x] Build your project using npm and webpack.
- [x] Create the website with very minimal HTML, e.g. by appending each new element to div#content with Javascript once the page is first loaded.
- [x] Use tabbed browsing to access the Contact and Menu pages.
- [x] Write the tab-switching logic inside of index.js. Add event listeners for each button in the header navbar that wipes out the current contents of div#content.

What I Learned
-----

I learned how to build a website by manipulating the DOM entirely through Javascript. I also learned how to build a basic webpack-powered app and upload it to Github Pages.
